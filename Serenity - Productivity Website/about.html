              Here at Serenity, our focus is improving people's lives in the world by combating issues of working from home. We aim to reconnect our users, with nature's ambiance and tranquility, by invoking the hearing and visual stimuli.

Market research indicates that the primary issue faced by individuals working from home during COVID19 was productivity and time-management. However, mental and physical have a direct link with productivity when working from home. For this reason, essential features like a meditation section have been incorporated to help relieve the stresses our users face when working from home. </p> <br>

<p> Serenity enables users to track their work or study with an easy-to-use to-do widget. Users can increase motivation by clarifying their goals and develop a better understanding of what they are working towards. The benefits of writing things down may also enhance the user's memory while making it clear to the brain what needs to be prioritised.

  Our webpage also gives the user the ability to customise their experience through a selection of themed pages with moving backgrounds and embedded APIs for music. During our research stage, we found that scenes of nature can help to both alleviate stress and clear the mind for more effective study and work. </p> <br>

Although we achieved what we set out to do, it was not an easy task. We faced many challenges along the way. We also struggled in the beginning to bridge the gap between idea and product. Excited to push the limits, we initially came up with many innovative ideas, but knowing our current capabilities and the time left to learn more, we decided to take a more realistic approach.

Nonetheless, we are proud of the development and growth we have all experienced from this project. With almost zero experience in coding, we as individuals used this project as an opportunity to take a step into the unknown, broaden our skillsets and challenge our creativity.
